## 2. Project setup

### Step 1 of 4 - Clone

The repository has submodules. If you haven't cloned the repository already, run:

```shell
git clone --recursive git@github.com:redgreenio/timelapse.git
```

If you have already cloned the repository without the `--recursive` option. Then `cd` into the project directory and
then run,

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Step 2 of 4 - Verify & run

`cd` into the project directory and run the following Gradle tasks.

**Windows**

```shell
gradlew test run
```

**Linux & macOS**

```shell
./gradlew test run
```

If the build succeeds, you should be able to see this screen!

```

### Step 4 of 4 - Install dev-cli

See [dev-cli's README](/tools/dev-cli/README.md) for installation and usage.

## 3. Other tools

### 1. Diff (macOS)

To generate unified diffs for reproducing bugs or handling new use cases, make use of the `diff` utility.

```shell
diff -u a.txt b.txt
```

### 2. ProGuard

ProGuard can come in handy to de-obfuscate stack traces from production.

The runnable jars are placed inside the `/tools/proguard` directory.

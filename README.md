# Timelapse

Timelapse onboards developers onto codebases before you make that cup of instant noodles!

## Project setup

### Step 1 of 3 - Clone

The repository has submodules. If you haven't cloned the repository already, run:

```shell
git clone --recursive git@github.com:redgreenio/timelapse.git
```

If you have already cloned the repository without the `--recursive` option. Then `cd` into the project directory and
then run,

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Step 2 of 3 - Verify & run

`cd` into the project directory and run the following Gradle tasks.

**Windows**

```shell
gradlew test run
```

**Linux & macOS**

```shell
./gradlew test run
```

If the build succeeds, you should be able to see this screen!

### Step 3 of 3 - Install Git hooks

**Windows**

```shell
gradlew installGitHooks
```

**Linux & macOS**

```shell
./gradlew installGitHooks
```

### ProGuard

Create a new directory inside the project directory for de-obfuscating ProGuard traces from production.

```shell
mkdir proguard-lab
```

## üöÄ Creating a release

### Step 1 of 7 - Get the version for the release

Run the following command to get the version.

```shell
gradlew nextInternalVersion
```

The task will print an output similar to the one shown below.

<pre>
Next INTERNAL version should be: <b>2021.0.2</b>
</pre>

Use the printed version for the release.

### Step 2 of 7 - Update CHANGELOG

Underneath the `## [Unreleased]` section, add the version and date in the following format.

```md
## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

Example,
```md
## [2021.0.1] - 2021-04-13
```

### Step 3 of 7 - Update version in code and buildscript

- `TimelapseApp.kt` - update `APP_VERSION` to reflect the current version.
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - update `version` to reflect the current version.
- Stage and commit all changes with the message `build: bump version for release`.

### Step 4 of 7 - Build native package

```shell
gradlew jpackageImage jpackage
```

This will create a distributable native installer (currently `.dmg`) for **macOS**. Windows and Linux distributions are
yet to be tested.

### Step 5 of 7 - Verifying the build

You should see the version number for the build in two places,
1. **The native package** - file name of the binary should contain the version number.
2. **The application (after installation)** - Welcome screen should display the new version number in the bottom right corner.

### Step 6 of 7 - Tag the release

Add a git tag to the release with the version number and push it to remote.

```shell
git tag <version>
```

```shell
git push origin <version>
```

### Step 7 of 7 - Preparing for the next release

**5.1 Determine the version number for the next release.**

If the current release was public, then append `.1`
to the version name. Example, if the current release was `2021.3`, the next would be `2021.3.1`.

If the current release was internal, then increment the `build-number` by 1. For example, if the current release was
`2021.4.10`, the next would be `2021.4.11`.

**5.2 Go to step 2 and update the version accordingly.**

## Distribution

| Operating System | Native Builds | Auto-updates |   Format  |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| macOS            | ‚úÖ            | In-progress  | `.dmg`    |
| Windows          | ‚ùå            | ‚ùå           | `-`       |
| Linux            | ‚ùå            | ‚ùå           | `-`       |

# üöÄ Creating a release

Ensure the working directory is clean before creating a release. Stash or commit changes to a different branch if the
working directory is dirty.

## Step 1 of 7 - Get the version for the release

Run the following command to get the version.

```shell
gradlew nextInternalVersion
```

The task will print an output similar to the one shown below.

<pre>
Next INTERNAL version should be: <b>2021.0.2</b>
</pre>

Use the printed version for the release.

## Step 2 of 7 - Update CHANGELOG

Underneath the `## [Unreleased]` section, add the version and date in the following format.

```md
## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

Example,

```md
## [2021.0.2] - 2021-04-13
```

## Step 3 of 7 - Commit changes

Stage and commit changes.

```shell
git add .

git commit -m "docs: update CHANGELOG"
```

## Step 4 of 7 - Build native package

```shell
gradlew jpackageImage jpackage
```

This will create a distributable native installer (currently `.dmg`) for **macOS**. Windows and Linux distributions are
yet to be tested.

## Step 5 of 7 - Verifying the build

You should see the version number for the build in two places,

1. **The native package** - file name of the binary should contain the version number.
2. **The application (after installation)** - Welcome screen should display the new version number in the bottom right
   corner.

## Step 6 of 7 - Tag the release

Add a git tag to the release with the version number and push it to remote.

```shell
git tag 2021.0.2
```

```shell
git push origin 2021.0.2
```

## Step 7 of 7 - Preparing for the next release

Determine the version number for the next release.

```shell
gradlew nextInternalVersion
```

Use the version number to update the following files.

- `TimelapseApp.kt` - update `APP_VERSION` to reflect the current version.
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - update `version` to reflect the current version.

Stage and commit changes.

```shell
git add .

git commit -m "build: prepare for next development version"
```
